\section{自然語言處理}{12.4}

自然語言處理（NLP）是電腦使用人類的語言，包括英語或法語等。特殊設計的计算机程序通常读取和发出专门的语言，目的在允许通过简单的程序进行高效和明确的解析。

Natural language processing (NLP) is the use of human languages, such as English or French, by a computer. Computer programs typically read and emit specialized languages designed to allow efficient and unambiguous parsing by simple programs. More naturally occurring languages are often ambiguous and defy formal description. Natural language processing includes applications such as machine translation, in which the learner must read a sentence in one human language and emit an equivalent sentence in another human language. Many NLP applications are based on language models that define a probability distribution over sequences of words, characters or bytes in a natural language.
